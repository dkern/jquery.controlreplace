jQuery.controlReplace();
========================

This is a simple jQuery Plugin only used by my own. It can replace checkboxes, radio-buttons and select elements with html and css.
Take a look on the examples to understand what is does.

Feel free to use it, but keep in mind, this may **not be bug-free or completely tested**.
